## What is ClearPath?

ClearPath is a browser extension that transforms any webpage into something a person can actually read, understand, and engage with. It started from a simple observation: tools like AAC apps help people communicate, but the web itself still isn't built for many of those people.

ClearPath bridges that gap — directly in the browser, on any site, with no account required.

**Core features:**
- 🔊 **Read Aloud** — Text-to-speech with word-by-word highlighting, built into every page
- 🧠 **Simplify** — Rewrites selected text at a plain language reading level using an LLM
- 📖 **Reading Mode** — Strips clutter, applies dyslexia-friendly fonts, customizable typography
- 🖼️ **Symbol Overlay** — Displays AAC-style symbols above words (powered by the open ARASAAC library)
- 🎯 **Focus Tools** — Reading ruler, paragraph dimming, and word complexity highlighting
- 👤 **Profiles** — Save and share accessibility settings (great for SLPs configuring for clients)

No data collected. No server. No login. Everything stays in your browser.
